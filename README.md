# NCR Property Price Estimation

**Status:** Active development

---

## Overview
This project aims to build a production-style machine learning system for estimating residential property prices across the National Capital Region (NCR) of India.

The focus extends beyond predictive performance to include reproducibility, modular system design, data versioning, and deployment readiness — reflecting real-world data science practices.

---

## Business Objective
Accurate property valuation is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate platforms. Mispricing can lead to financial loss, delayed transactions, and inefficient market behavior.

The goal of this system is to generate reliable price estimates using property characteristics, location-based signals, and data-driven modeling techniques.

## Project Goals
- Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline  
- Implement robust feature engineering  
- Compare multiple modeling approaches  
- Ensure reproducibility of datasets and experiments  
- Prepare the system for production deployment  
- Integrate CI/CD workflows for automated validation  

---

## Planned Tech Stack
*(Will evolve as the project progresses)*

- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Scikit-learn / Gradient Boosting models  
- DVC for data and model versioning  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
- FastAPI for model serving  
- Docker for containerization

## Dataset
The dataset will be added in the next phase of the project.

Raw data will not be stored in this repository due to size constraints. Instructions for accessing the dataset will be provided once finalized.

---

## Project Status
**Current Stage:** Repository initialization and project structuring  

**Next Steps:**
1. Acquire and validate dataset  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis  
3. Establish a baseline model  
4. Build a reproducible training pipeline  
5. Introduce data versioning with DVC  
6. Deploy an inference API  

---

## Repository Structure
This repository follows a modular architecture inspired by production machine learning systems. Data, features, modeling logic, and configuration are separated to support maintainability and scalability.

---

## Why This Project
Many portfolio projects focus solely on model training. This project is designed to demonstrate production-aware data science, where reliability, reproducibility, and system design are treated as primary concerns.
